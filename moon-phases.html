                  <p>Everything you need is coming into place. But it is important during this time to take a step back and observe. Are your dreams turning out the way you envisioned? If not, it's time to reevaluate and refine.</p>

                  <p>The Full Moon brings clarity to what is truly important in life. Be careful, as emotions run high during this time. Take this clarity and apply it to your actions so far. What has been serving you and what hasn't?</p>
